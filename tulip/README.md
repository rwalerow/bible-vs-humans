# Why did I prepare this?

As explination of how I see stuff and what I think, and as a help and resource to think on your own time and on your own pase


# How to use this?

### How can you approach this?

In this folder you hava all resources I would like to use in markdown files, they are easy to open and read in the browser.

You can either:
- Go over tuplit points one by one(I number the files for convinience)
- Go directly to the resources.md and watch/read with autotranslate option

### From my side

I think it's benefitial to make your own mind about some topics, that's why it's benefitial to know both sides about some topic. Since I think you might have encountered one side, this is to provide another one.

I believe you can make up your own mind, and decide for yourself.

I'll try to privide all kind of resources in 3 languages
Polish, English and Russian. If it's not possible I also provided instruction how to autotranslate either webpage or youtube video.


### Every place I'll quote from 3 Bibles

- Polish - UWG(Uwspółcześniona Biblia Gdańska)
- English - KJV(King James Version)
- Russian - RUSV(Russian Synodal Version, not sure if this is good one, prefer non catholic/non east ortodox translation)

All of those can be found here:
[Bible gateway](https://www.biblegateway.com/)

### What is my advise?

I strongly encourage you to investiage yourself, to look into stuff by yourself, first yourself read think about it then ask questions and see if makes sense. 

I encourage to pray before investigation, ask Holy Spirit and God for guidiance and to discover things of God, not of man. 

I encourage to read the Bible, if somebody gives quotes of the Bible to go there, and read by yourselve.

I engourage to read quote in context, reading a little bit before(4-5 verses, and 3-4 afterwards) to figure out if someounes interpretation makes sance, or is it out of context


Thats why: If I'll qoute something(small part) I will also provide link to the Bible with wider context.
